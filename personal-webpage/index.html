                   <p class="description"> Why did I choose this course program?</p>
                   <p class="description"> Back in 2017, during my internship as a Market Reseach Analyst, I discovered how important it is for businesses to leverage on technology in order to stay relevant in the market. Just as businesses need to constantly evolve, I too wanted to evolve my skills and knowledge in the world of technology.</p>

                   <p class="description"> Why did I choose this course program?</p>
                   <p class="description"> I always had an interest in entrepreneurship and a goal of running my own business someday. To learn what it takes to run a successful business, I had chosen to take up business management in my undergrad. By specializing in finance, I learned how to critically perform cost-benefit analysis which I can apply to almost any project that involves decision making.</p>
